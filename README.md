<h1>LoginApp</h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
I'm presenting a simple code I've done for studying reasons in Java. The main idea of it is to check entered username and password and search for them in the simple array. If your data matches the one in the array you will be authenticated as a user. The code is working, and may be developed in the future.

<h2> Technology </h2>
The code was written in Intelij Community Edition 2020.3.2 in Java.

<h2> Launch </h2>
To launch the code you can simply just copy it, and try on your own!
